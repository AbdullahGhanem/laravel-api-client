# Laravel package for Accessing API's

A little API Builder Library

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require macsidigital/laravel-api-builder
```

## Usage

The main aim of this library is to add a common set of traits to models to be able to create, update, retrieve and delete records when accessing API's.  OBviously all API's are different so you should check documentation on how best to implement with these traits.
